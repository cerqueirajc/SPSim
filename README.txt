----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Installation

Requirements:
	-Python version 3 or later
	-Numpy
	-Scipy
	-Matplotlib
	-LTspice

- Under windows, it is recommended to install a custom Python distribution that already
comes with several packages, including the needed packages. For example, Anaconda is an
easy distribution to download and install ("https://anaconda.org/", remember to choose
version 3+). Otherwise, you can download the latest Python from "https://www.python.org/"
and download each package individually.
- This software were not tested under any Linux distribution.
- Unzip the folder SolarSim to the desired place, all executables and Python files needed
are inside this folder.
- The LTspice executable ("scad3.exe") must be inside the SPSim's folder to guarantee
the software operation. If any problem is found with LTspice, try to reinstall it from
"http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/" and overwrite the "scad3.exe" file inside 
the SPSim folder.


2) Running

- To execute the program the user must open the "SPSim.py" file with a Python 
distribution that satisfies section 1). On windows, do a right-click on the file, find 
the "Open With..." option, find the folder where Python is installed and choose the 
python.exe. 
- If you want to open "SPSim.py" with double-click, set python.exe as the default
program when opening files with .py extension.


3) Using the software

- On the first screen the user must input the datasheet values of the desired PV panel, 
select the number of panels in parallel and in series and the bypass diode positions. 
After setting these variables, hit the "Create Grid" button.
- The simulation parameters are automatically generated from the datasheet values. The
circuit model used on this software is a simple diode, with an ideality constant "A" and a 
saturation current "I0", in parallel with a current souce with value "Iph" (when operating
on STC) with a shunt resistance "Rsh" in parallel and a series resistance "Rs". These values
may also be manually changed by the user using the "Apply Changes" button.
- The Grid temperature and irradiance may be changed through the "Customize Grid Panels"
window. The user can set new values for the whole grid, for each panel or even for each cell 
that compose the panels. It means that each cell is simulated individually by this software
with its own temperature and irradiance. Also, the "Hotspot" defect may be selected for a 
cell to simulate any defective panel with precision. Finally, the bypass diodes temperature
may also be changed for each panel.
- After customising the grid, the Simulation Options must be configured as desired and after
clicking the "Simulate" button, a spice circuit is written and simulated with the LTSpice
software. The output data can be found inside the "workspace" folder. 
- The LTSpice output is a .raw file. The user may open it with the LTSpice software (and use
its features to plot the data). Also, "Open Results" window may be used to open the .raw 
files generated by the SolarSim.
- The program interface is simple and straightforward. Most functionalities may be easily 
discovered by spending some time using the software.
